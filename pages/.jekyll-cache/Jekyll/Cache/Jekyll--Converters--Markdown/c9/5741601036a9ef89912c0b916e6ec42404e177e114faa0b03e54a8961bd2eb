<p>Installation process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the build to a PC with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adb</code> available.</li>
  <li>Power off the device.</li>
  <li>On the Pixels, hold volume down + power to launch fastboot mode. On the Mi A2, hold volume up + power to directly go into recovery. Mi A2 users can skip the next step</li>
  <li>Use the volume buttons to scroll the fastboot menu, and select “Recovery mode”. Use the power button to confirm.</li>
  <li>You will see an icon (like the one below) with the text “no command”. This is completely <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
  <li>Hold power, and while keeping power held, press the volume up button and release it.</li>
  <li>This should bring you to a menu with multiple items, saying “Android Recovery” at the top.</li>
  <li>Use the volume button to scroll to “Apply update from ADB”. It’ll be the third or fourth item depending on the device. Select it using the power button</li>
  <li>This will bring you to a black screen with some text at the bottom, at which point the phone is waiting for commands from the PC.</li>
  <li>Connect your phone to the PC, and run</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adb sideload the-ota-update-you-downloaded.zip</code></li>
  <li>This will take a few minutes.</li>
  <li>When done, select reboot system and you will have it installed.</li>
</ol>
