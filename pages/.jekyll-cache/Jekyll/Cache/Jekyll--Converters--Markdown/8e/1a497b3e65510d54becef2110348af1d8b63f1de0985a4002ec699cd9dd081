  <h2>Signal</h2>
  <p><b>Signal Private Messenger</b></p>
  <p>Privacy is possible. Signal makes it easy.</p>
  <p>Using Signal, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create groups so that you can chat in real time with all your friends at once, and share media or other files all with complete privacy. Signal’s servers never have access to any of your communication and never store any of your data.</p>
  <p>★ Say Anything. Signal uses an advanced end-to-end encryption protocol to keep your conversations private. Every message, every call, every time.</p>
  <p>★ Open Source. Signal is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code. Signal is the only private messenger that uses open source peer-reviewed cryptographic protocols to keep your messages and calls safe.</p>
  <p>★ Be Yourself - Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.</p>
  <p>★ Group Chat. Signal allows you to create encrypted groups so you can have private conversations with all your friends at once. Not only are the messages encrypted, but the Signal server never has access to any group metadata such as the membership list, group title, or group icon.</p>
  <p>★ Fast. The Signal protocol is designed to operate in the most constrained environment possible. Using Signal, messages are instantly delivered to friends.</p>
  <p>★ Speak Freely - Make crystal-clear phone calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.</p>

  <h2>Briar</h2>
  <p><b>Secure Messaging, Anywhere</b></p>
  <p>Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike traditional messaging tools such as email, Twitter or Telegram, Briar doesn’t rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users’ devices. If the Internet’s down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet’s up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.</p>
