<p>Things to consider</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prompt to install apps from the local F-Droid repo. See <a href="../F‐Droid">F-Droid#local-repo</a>
    <ul>
      <li>An issue with this would be that some apps may have an update right after install.</li>
      <li>Another thing to do, set installer package name to F-Droid so that it can manage the app later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prompt to enable microG. See <a href="../microG">microG</a></li>
  <li>Ask F-Droid to update the index while the setup process is going on.</li>
</ul>
