<ul>
  <li>Could be changed to prebuilt once F-Droid is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PRESIGNED</code></li>

<ul>
  <li>A local repo has been created to help with the initial app install during SetupWizard</li>
</ul>

<p>TODO: Figure out the exact semantics here</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideally, it would be a partial mirror</li>
  <li>The apps included currently are either from the F-Droid repo, or from the Guardian Project repo, as-is, prebuilt, presigned.</li>
  <li>Only outlier is Signal, apk grabbed from the website.</li>
  <li>Should include some basic info about apps, right now all thatâ€™s included is a barebones index + the apks themselves, no icons either.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calyx-repo---httpsgitlabcomcalyxoscalyxosissues7">Calyx repo - https://gitlab.com/calyxos/calyxos/issues/7</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To include apps such as Chromium.</li>
