<h3 id="signature-spoofing">Signature Spoofing</h3>
<p>microG Services Core (GmsCore) pretends to be Google Play Services by using the same package name. Apps also expect this to be signed by Googleâ€™s keys, which we achieve by spoofing the signature that apps see to be that of Google Play Services.</p>

<p>On CalyxOS, <a href="https://review.calyxos.org/c/CalyxOS/platform_frameworks_base/+/388">signature spoofing</a> is implemented in a very restricive manner. We have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made the permission <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">signature|privileged</code> so only system apps signed with the right key, or privileged system apps with an explicit allowlist for this permission can use it.</li>
  <li>Hardcoded the signature to be spoofed instead of letting the application specify it.</li>
  <li>Only allowed the microG packages, GmsCore and Store to spoof signature. Both of these are included as system apps on CalyxOS so simply checking against the package name is enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach means that as far as microG is concerned, the behavior remains pretty much the same, while also not letting any other app use this functionality.</p>
