I"˜<p>We have a Gerrit Code Review Instance now at https://review.calyxos.org/</p>

<p>Gerrit makes a lot easier to deal with hundreds of repositories in one place, and also for dealing with changes involving multiple repos.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started">Getting: Started</h3>
<p>1) Visit https://review.calyxos.org/ - and click Sign in. That will take you to GitHub, where you can approve the request to sign in. (GitLab oauth plugin was broken at time of deploy)
2) Go to https://review.calyxos.org/settings/#Profile - and set a Display Name, and note down your username (will be the same as your GitHub username)
3) Scroll down to https://review.calyxos.org/settings/#EmailAddresses - and add an email address or two. You will need to verify them by clicking on a link sent to the particular email.
4) Scroll down to https://review.calyxos.org/settings/#SSHKeys - and add an SSH key. This is what you will use to push code changes to Gerrit.
5) Add your Gerrit/GitHub username to gitconfig - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config --add --global review.review.calyxos.org.username $USERNAME</code> - the double review in review.review. is intentional</p>

<h3 id="workflow">Workflow:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This is divided into two parts, one for those working on the AOSP / CalyxOS code, and another for any other supporting repositories</li>
  <li>The repositories are still to be cloned via GitLab just like before - use https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/$projectname</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="calyxos">CalyxOS:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If you had the source code synced before October, you should download the files ‚Äòold-new‚Äô and ‚Äòrepo.sh‚Äô from https://git.io/JUb6h to your checkout (where you ran repo init / sync) - and then run repo.sh</li>
  <li>For new checkouts, it will work out of the box</li>
  <li>You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repo upload</code> tool to upload changes.</li>
  <li>You can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repopick</code> tool, available after <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source envsetup.sh</code> - to quickly download changes from gerrit.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="calyx">Calyx:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We use a tool called ‚Äògit-review‚Äô for these repos, available from https://docs.openstack.org/infra/git-review/</li>
  <li>This is configured by a ‚Äò.gitreview‚Äô file in the root of the repo, which has already been added to all the relevant repos</li>
  <li>Make your changes, and then simply run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git review</code> to upload them to gerrit.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="common">Common:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Open Changes can be viewed on the main gerrit homepage - https://review.calyxos.org/</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="change-id">Change-Id</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Gerrit tracks changes using Change-Ids, which will automatically be added to your commit messages with a hook.</li>
  <li>Change-Ids are unique per-project per-branch, so you can share the Change-Id across projects (for one patch affecting multiple repos), or across branches (porting a previous feature) to keep things easier to track</li>
  <li>Change-Ids are also how it knows whether to update an existing change, or create a new change</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="review">Review</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can ask for review using the ‚ÄúAdd Review‚Äù button on the left.</li>
  <li>You can leave comments on individual files and even the commit message, and hit Reply to Submit</li>
  <li>Reply also has options to set a score.</li>
  <li>Code-Review is used to review the code. +1/-1 are like thumbs up / down. +2 is needed to merge a change, and -2 prevents a change from being merged.</li>
  <li>Verified is used to indicate if the code builds. We‚Äôll have CI for this later, but for now you can mark stuff you compiled as +1, and -1 if it‚Äôs WiP / doesn‚Äôt compile yet.</li>
  <li>Setting Verified+1 and Code-Review+1 on your own changes that you want reviewed / merged is good practice.</li>
  <li>Once a change has at least one Verified +1 and Code-Review +2, it can be submitted using the ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù button which then appears.</li>
  <li>A change can also be abandoned.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="topics">Topics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Topics are another way to group changes together, and super useful with something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repopick -t $topic</code> to be able to pick a set of changes easily.</li>
</ul>
