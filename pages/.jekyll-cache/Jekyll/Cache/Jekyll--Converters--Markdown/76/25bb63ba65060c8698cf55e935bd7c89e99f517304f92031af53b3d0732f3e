<p>A document listing the various machines used for CalyxOS development and release process</p>

<h2 id="calyxos-infra">CalyxOS Infra</h2>
<h4 id="calyxos-build-nyc">calyxos-build-nyc</h4>
<p>Capable of building Android in a reasonable time.
Used by cdesai for testing things.</p>

<h3 id="future-vms">Future VMs</h3>
<p>TODO: Add more details for this</p>
<h4 id="signing-vm">signing-vm</h4>
<p>A machine that would have a setup matching the offline signing machine. (Matching setup = number of cores/RAM/OS etc.)</p>

<p>Can be used to sign the current builds, but has to be fully scripted, no manual commands.</p>

<h4 id="build-vm">build-vm</h4>
<p>A VM dedicated to building, will not be used for anything else. Unsure if this is needed right now, can just use build-nyc for this.</p>

<p>Whenever this is setup though, it should be completely automated and no builds should have to be fired off manually.</p>
